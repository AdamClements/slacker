* Roadmap

** Features

*** DONE Server side interceptor framework                           :server:
    allow user to add interceptors to server pipeline. 
*** DONE Client HA, load balancing                                   :client:
    configure multiple server instances for a client. the client could
    kick abnormal server instances based on some algorithms like phi
    failure detection.
    We finally archived HA and LB by slacker cluster.
*** DONE HTTP transport support                                      :server:
    Expose functions via HTTP transport, which is more
    friendly for debugging. This also enables support for
    clojurescript.
**** DONE Build-in http server (via aleph.http)
*** TODO Upstream enhancement                                 :server:client:
    enhance performance of upstream libraries:
    - carbonite (0.1.1, keyword enhancement)
    - aleph (Zach Tellman is working on lamina performance improvement)
*** DONE Build-in interceptors                                       :server:
    some build-in interceptors for slacker server: 
    - function invocation stats (expose via JMX)
    - logging
    - memorize function (discard)
    - slow watch dog
    interceptors are better to shipped as standalone submodules
    (depends [[Server side interceptor framework]])
*** TODO Nodejs clojurescript support                                :client:
    support clojure RPC with nodejs tcp client. provide a consistent
    client style in clojurescript.
    Demo code: https://gist.github.com/1471511
    is there any dependencies management solution for cljs? how to
    release it as a cljs library ?
*** TODO Access control layer                                 :server:client:    
    add handshake phase before client-server communication
    starts. simple password authentication.
*** DONE Keep-alive, ping/pong packet                         :server:client:
    add ping/pong packet
*** TODO Move to Clojure 1.3
    A new branch is created for clojure 1.3. Upgrade aleph and
    carbonite to be compatible with 1.3
*** DONE HA with ZooKeeper                                    :server:client:
    Add a :zk option to start-slacker. Once server started, it will
    publish all the functions to zookeeper.
    A new slackerc-zk reads function/client from zookeeper and also
    get notified with server changes.
    Detailed and updated design can be found here: http://lazypress.cloudfoundry.com/p/i
*** DONE server introspection
    Add new protocol command to get metadata of slacker functions.
**** get all functions exposed by the server
**** get metadata of a particular function
*** TODO expose multiple namespace in a server                :server:client:
    Allow server to expose multiple namespaces. 
    Namespace is also added as prefix of function name between client 
    and server communication.
*** TODO Namespace awared cluster                             :server:client:
    Associate server to namesapces instead of functions, to adapt
    large scale cluster. We assume that namespace is the smallest
    gratuity in a cluster.
     
** Lower Priority Features
*** Browser clojurescript support                                    :client:
    support clojure RPC via javascript XMLHttpRequest. provide a
    consistent client style in clojurescript.
    (depends [[Slacker as a Ring handler]])
    (out of scope, maybe in a new project. "restful slacker"?)
**** Slacker as a Ring handler (out of scope, maybe in a new project)
